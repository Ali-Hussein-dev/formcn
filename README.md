A modern form builder that lets you build production-ready forms using shadcn/ui components.

## Motivation

Forms are tricky. They are one of the most common things you'll build in a web application, but also one of the most complex. While AI can help generate forms you need, the results are not predicatble and inconsistent and can use undesirable dependencies. Because form code is much a boilerplate code, we can automate it. 


## Features

- **Single/Multi-step forms** with smooth navigation
- **Formcn AI** scaffold forms fields without having to start from scratch
- **Type-safe validation** client and server side validation
- **Beautiful UI** with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
